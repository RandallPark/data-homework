# data-homework

I couldn't get GitHub to upload my word document...


1. What are three conclusions we can make about Kickstarter campaigns given the provided data?
• Theatre is the most popular category on Kickstarter, following that is music and then film
• Kickstarter projects are most successful in July
• Kickstarter projects are most likely going to be successful than failed or canceled

2. What are some of the limitations of this dataset?
• DOES THE TITLE SELL ITSELF?: There is no list of filtered search tags in this dataset, which would be interesting to see if certain filters, titles or specific words used can guarantee success
• SEARCH STUDY: Can’t see how sponsors find the campaigns they sponsored, such as direct link, email campaign, web ad, or surfing the website
• GLOBAL CONNECTIVITY: No way to see if campaigns got financial support from sponsors in other countries

3. What are some other possible tables/graphs that we could create?
• Visualizing relationship between when which years were popular to support Kickstarters and if majority of campaigns were also successful during those years
• Visualizing trends in the fastest goal achieving campaigns
• Visualizing relationship between goal amount and success
